<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Ali3N Network Scanner Pro</strong></p>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 2025</p>
<p><strong>Developer:</strong> Jonathan Lockhart</p>

<hr>

<div class="card">
    <p>
        Ali3N Network Scanner Pro (“the App”) is a local network analysis tool. It is designed
        to help you discover devices on your own network, scan ports, generate reports, and perform
        Wake-on-LAN operations.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains what information the App accesses, how it is used, and how
        it is stored. The App does <strong>not</strong> collect or transmit personal data to the developer
        or to any third parties.
    </p>
</div>

<h2>1. Information the App Does <em>Not</em> Collect</h2>
<p>The App does <strong>not</strong>:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Collect or store personal data on external servers.</li>
    <li>Send network scan results to the developer.</li>
    <li>Use advertising SDKs, trackers, or analytics services.</li>
    <li>Collect GPS location, contacts, SMS, or media.</li>
    <li>Store any information beyond what is required locally for app functionality.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Information the App <em>Does</em> Access</h2>

<h3>a) Local Network Information</h3>
<p>To perform network scanning, the App may access:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your device’s local IP address and subnet information.</li>
    <li>Devices discovered on your local network (e.g., IP, MAC, host name, vendor where available).</li>
    <li>Open ports on discovered devices, when you choose to run port scans.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    This information is used only to display results to you in the App and to create optional
    local CSV/PDF reports. All processing happens on your device and is not transmitted externally.
</p>

<h3>b) Location Permission (Technical Requirement)</h3>
<p>
    On modern versions of Android, access to Wi-Fi SSID and certain network details requires
    location-related permissions (such as <code>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION</code> or
    <code>ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION</code>).
</p>
<p>
    Ali3N Network Scanner Pro requests these permissions solely so it can determine your local
    network parameters and perform scans. The App does <strong>not</strong> attempt to determine or track your
    physical location, nor does it send any location information to the developer or to third parties.
</p>

<h3>c) Saved Scans and Notes</h3>
<p>
    If you choose to save scan results or add notes/tags to devices, this data is stored
    <strong>locally on your device</strong>. You may delete saved scans or clear app data at any time using
    your device’s operating system settings.
</p>

<h3>d) Wake-on-LAN (WOL)</h3>
<p>
    When you use the Wake-on-LAN feature, the App sends a broadcast “magic packet” on your local
    network using the target device’s MAC address. No WOL-related data is sent outside your local
    network or to the developer.
</p>

<h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>The App does <strong>not</strong> share data with:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The developer (no servers involved).</li>
    <li>Advertising networks.</li>
    <li>Analytics providers.</li>
    <li>Social networks or other third parties.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Any CSV or PDF exports you generate are stored or shared only through apps or locations you
    select (for example, email, cloud storage, etc.). Once exported, handling of those files is
    governed by the policies of the apps or services you choose.
</p>

<h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
    The App is intended for technical users and network administrators. It is not designed for
    children under 16. As the App does not collect personal data, it does not knowingly collect
    information from children.
</p>

<h2>5. Security</h2>
<p>
    Because the App does not send data to external servers, traditional server-side storage
    security is not applicable. Network scan results are processed in memory and optionally stored
    locally on your device as part of saved scans or exported files. You are responsible for securing
    your device and any exported files (e.g., CSV or PDF) that you choose to save or share.
</p>

<h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in functionality or
    legal requirements. The “Last updated” date at the top of this page will be revised accordingly.
    Significant changes may also be mentioned in the App’s release notes on the Google Play Store.
</p>

<h2>7. Contact</h2>
<p>
    If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or about how the App handles
    data, you may contact the developer at:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:jdlockhart@gmail.com">jdlockhart@gmail.com</a></li>
    <li><strong>Developer:</strong> Jonathan Lockhart</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<small>
    This Privacy Policy applies only to Ali3N Network Scanner Pro and not to any other apps,
    websites, or services that may be linked or used to share exported reports.
